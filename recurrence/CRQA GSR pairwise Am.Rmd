## RQA on GSR for Am Players

for general justification of using the crqa package for aRQA we looked at e.g.:  https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3576050.3576113#BibPLXBIB0009

## Parameter Estimation for each player's GSR

We need the embedding dimension, the delay,and the radius: since the data is continuous we need to estimate the parameters 

Following the suggestions here: 
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9447059 
https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01679/full 

Delay: AMI 
Embedding Dimension: false-nearest-neighbors (alternative from lecture: Cao)
Radius: should give 1-5% recurrence (according to lecture)

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9447059  on radius selection: 
3) Estimating Threshold Radius (ε): The final parameter to
construct an appropriate RP is to select the threshold radius
(ε). The method proposed by Zbilut et al. [23] was adopted.
Accordingly, Rec was calculated for a range of radius between
0.01, 0.02, . . . , 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 1, 2 . . . , 10, and for all short-term
window sizes adopted in the study. A plot of thresholds vs
recurrence rates was constructed using a log scale as shown
in Figure 2. From the plot, the condition foot-after-noise
was located by observing the point after which there was
gradual and linear rise in the Rec. All window sizes satisfied
the criteria, however, for the window size of 60, valid Rec
only starts at the threshold 0.7 where a steady rise was
observed (indicated by dashed line in the Figure 2). Thus,
to accommodate the smallest window size of 60, a threshold
ε of 0.7 was considered for subsequent analysis. Further, the
corresponding Rec of 0.067 satisfied the suggested nominal
recurrence rate of 0.01 or 1%. 

## Player 0 

```{r}
# get AMI to select delay 
# select a bin size using Sturges' rule (1926)
bin = ceil(1 + log2(nrow(Am0)))

mutual(Am0$gsr, bin, 50, plot = TRUE)

```

```{r}
# choose delay 

delay_0 = 44

```

FNN seems flawed for this kind of data: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4148166?arnumber=4148166 probably due to noise

Therefore choose Cao's method for estimating the embedding dimension instead 
```{r}
# Cao, L. (1997). Practical method for determining the minimum embedding dimension of a scalar time series. Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 110(1-2), 43-50.
embeddim_0 = estimateEmbeddingDim(Am0$gsr, time.lag = delay_0, max.embedding.dim = 20)

```
```{r}
print(embeddim_0)

```

## Player 1

```{r}
# get AMI to select delay 
# select a bin size using Sturges' rule (1926)
bin = ceil(1 + log2(nrow(Am1)))

mutual(Am1$gsr, bin, 50, plot = TRUE)

```

```{r}
# choose delay 

delay_1 = 8

```
```{r}
# Cao, L. (1997). Practical method for determining the minimum embedding dimension of a scalar time series. Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 110(1-2), 43-50.
embeddim_1 = estimateEmbeddingDim(Am1$gsr, time.lag = delay_1, max.embedding.dim = 20)

```
```{r}
print(embeddim_1)

```


## Player 2 

```{r}
# get AMI to select delay 
# select a bin size using Sturges' rule (1926)
bin = ceil(1 + log2(nrow(Am2)))

mutual(Am2$gsr, bin, 50, plot = TRUE)

```

```{r}
# choose delay 

delay_2 = 42

```

```{r}
# Cao, L. (1997). Practical method for determining the minimum embedding dimension of a scalar time series. Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 110(1-2), 43-50.
embeddim_2 = estimateEmbeddingDim(Am2$gsr, time.lag = delay_2, max.embedding.dim = 20)

```
```{r}
print(embeddim_2)

```

## Player 3 

```{r}
# get AMI to select delay 
# select a bin size using Sturges' rule (1926)
bin = ceil(1 + log2(nrow(Am3)))

mutual(Am3$gsr, bin, 50, plot = TRUE)

```

```{r}
# choose delay 

delay_3 = 38

```


```{r}
# Cao, L. (1997). Practical method for determining the minimum embedding dimension of a scalar time series. Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 110(1-2), 43-50.
embeddim_3 = estimateEmbeddingDim(Am3$gsr, time.lag = delay_3, max.embedding.dim = 20)

```
```{r}
print(embeddim_3)

```


## Player 4 

```{r}
# get AMI to select delay 
# select a bin size using Sturges' rule (1926)
bin = ceil(1 + log2(nrow(Am4)))

mutual(Am4$gsr, bin, 50, plot = TRUE)

```

```{r}
# choose delay 

delay_4 = 40

```

```{r}
# Cao, L. (1997). Practical method for determining the minimum embedding dimension of a scalar time series. Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 110(1-2), 43-50.
embeddim_4 = estimateEmbeddingDim(Am4$gsr, time.lag = delay_4, max.embedding.dim = 20)

```
```{r}
print(embeddim_4)

```

### Choose one set of parameters for all players 
Choose values somewhat above the average according to Wallot & Leonardi (2018) since the values for player 1 vary quite much from all others 

```{r}

delay = mean(c(delay_0, delay_1, delay_2, delay_3, delay_4)) + 2
embeddim =  mean(c(embeddim_0, embeddim_1, embeddim_2, embeddim_3, embeddim_4)) + 2

print(delay)
print(embeddim)

```
Start with an arbitrary radius of 0.3 -- too small, go up to 0.4 -- better though player 1 falls out of the picture a little and has way smaller RR than the others 

```{r}
radius = 0.4
```


## Get the RQA plots
Fill in the estimated embedding dimension and lag - radius should be chosen so that the RR is around 1-5% 
Try different radii between 0.01 & 10 !!! 
According to e.g. Wallot & Leonardi (2018) a single set of parameters that fits all samples should be found in order to properly compare between all of them.

## Get the MdRQA for all five players 
following the instructions in the paper we can embed the five-dimensional time series once at the estimated average delay we selected above to get a 10-dimensional phase space that is quite well in line with the embedding dimensions we estimated before (slightly higher embedding dim according to Wallot and Leonardi 2018 okay) 
```{r}
  
delay = delay; embed = 2; rescale = 1; radius = radius;
normalize = 0; mindiagline = 2; minvertline = 2;
tw = 0; whiteline = FALSE; recpt = FALSE; side = "both"
method = 'mdcrqa'; metric = 'euclidean';  
datatype = "continuous"

all_players <- as.matrix(cbind(Am0$gsr, Am1$gsr, Am2$gsr, Am3$gsr, Am4$gsr))

mdrqa5_results <- crqa(all_players, all_players, delay, embed, rescale, radius, normalize, 
           mindiagline, minvertline, tw, whiteline, recpt, side, method,
           metric, datatype)

round(unlist(mdrqa5_results[1:9]), digit = 2)
```

```{r}
# safe and convert into numeric matrix for plotting 
MdRP = mdrqa5_results$RP
MdRP = matrix(as.numeric(MdRP), nrow(MdRP))
```


```{r, fig.width = 16, fig.height = 10}
# use the standard plotting function
plotRP(MdRP,
